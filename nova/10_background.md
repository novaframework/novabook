## Background ##

### Erlang web frameworks ###

Both me and Niclas have used many different web frameworks in Erlang. We started to code Erlang around 2009 and at that time we had frameworks like Nitrogen, Erlang Web and Zotonic. Some years later Chicago Boss was introduced that tried to solve many things. But one of the things with Chicago Boss was that it didn't really follow OTP standard when it came to release handling.

In 2011 Loïc Hoguin released Cowboy, an Erlang web server. It was very fast and stable web server that got popular in the Erlang community.

Many Erlang companies started to use Cowboy and everytime me or Niclas came in contact with it we needed to start writing all the handlers, or work with a wrapper around.

I started my Erlang coding with a project course at Uppsala University where we did a e-commerce system written with Nitrogen and Riak. This was late 2009, riak was a new and untested database also was Nitrogen something new.

From this both me and Niclas have helped companies to launch web applications with Erlang or as employees develop these kind of systems.

### The beginning ###

In a hotel room in Gratz we started to look at some of our projects we have started during all the years. Niclas had earlier started a framework called Burbweb, this would later be the start of Nova. Some years before that we had worked on a ORM library in Erlang. We got an idea that we should try to make a product of this and really try to aim for a new good framework that people can use.

We started to look into how we can help users to get started easy and also try to make easy release builds.

So in 2019 we released Nova that we now have worked on and try to make it better.

Zaark was a company that both me and Niclas worked at and later started to use Nova in production. Mostly as a api server without views. From the feedback using Nova we improved it and felt we are doing something great.

2020 we had our first presentation about Nova at code beam.
